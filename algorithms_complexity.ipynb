        "Sometimes, a customer wants a laptop with some characteristics such as, for instance, 8GB or RAM and a 256GB hard drive. It would be interesting for those customers to provide a way to find the cheapest laptop that matches the desired characteristics. For simplicity, focus only on the amount of RAM and hard drive capacity. You might need to convert those values to integers rather than using strings.\n",
        "* In this project, we only explored three possible queries that we might want to do over the data. In general, we often have a lot of different datasets to process and queries to answer. Designing such a class for every type of data in a business and implementing specific query methods takes a lot of time\n"
